# NAME vid-tag

Rename video files and set Title / Caption / Keywords metadata.

# SYNOPSIS

First run. Create initial config file: `./vid-tag.conf`

    vid-tag -n -e "pEventId" [File1 File2 ...]

Edit config files, and/or use these options to override config file.

    vid-tag -e "pEventId" File1 [File2 ...]
        [-p "pInitials"] [-P "pName"] [-C "pCaption"] [-R "pCopyright"]
        [-E "pEventTitle"] [-c "pCity"] [-k "pKeyword"]
        [-f "pFilePattern"] [-t "pTitlePattern"]
        [-z "pTimeZone"] [-T]
        [-n] [-h] [-H pStyle] [-v] [-d]

# DESCRIPTION

vid-tag renames one or more video files and writes Title, Caption, and
Keywords metadata using the `exiftool`.  The file's `Create Date`
metadata is read and used to date-stamp the output file name, the
output title, and the file-system mtime.

Files are copied to the ./output/ directory, so the original files are
not changed in any way.

Files (in ./output/) will be renamed using the pFilePattern and the
EXIF values will be added to the renamed files

Large files, greater than 10 min, will be split into multiple 10 min
parts (because some hosting sites do not allow "large" files). The
exif time stamps for the split files will update for each 10 min part.

An example file, `./vid-tag-example.txt`, will be created to show the
changes that are (or will be) made to the files with the current
settings. This is best used with the -n option and if you include all the
files, the time stamps will match what is in the files.

If the timestamps for the files are "off" by a consistent amount
the time-zone (-z) config option can be used to adjust the times.

The config options are read in this order (each layer overrides the
previous):

- Built-in script defaults.
- Local config: `./vid-tag.conf` If the file does not exist it
will be created, and updated with the latest default settings.
- Command-line options will override all other settings.

After all the values are set, the results are saved to
`./vid-tag.conf` so the next run will only need the -e option and the
file list.

## QUICK START

### Install

- Download the latest packaged zip file, `vid-tag-VER.zip` from

        https://moria.whyayh.com/rel/released/software/own/vid-tag/

- Unpack the zip file to your "bin" dir.

    Typical choices:

        /usr/local/bin
        $HOME/bin
        /opt/vid-tag

    Just make sure the install dir is in your PATH env. var.

### First run of vid-tag

- cd to the directory with your video files (or the directory
where you want ./output/ created).  Copy the `vid-tag.conf` file from
the install dir. This is optional. If missing a default version will
be created.

        Run: vid-tag -n -e testevent

- That will create or update `./vid-tag.conf` and
`vid-tag-example.txt` files.
- You can now edit the `vid-tag.conf` file, or use the command line
options to update the file. You want to change "testevent" to a short
ID that will be put in your renamed video files. See the -e option.

### Tips

- See the -f option for how you can change the file naming
pattern, and the -t option for how you can change the Title pattern.
- Use the -v option to see some progress information. Use -vv if
you want to see more progress details.
- After each run, the `vid-tag.conf` file is updated with any
changes, and the `vid-tag-example.txt` file will summarize how the
files are modified.
- Between each run you should probably remove everything in the
./outputs/ directory. Or you can leave the files there and they will
be skipped from any changes.
- Use the -z option if the file time are off by a consistent
ammount, because you forgot to set the current time with your camera,
or your camera uses UTC times and you want them adjusted to the local
time.

# OPTIONS

- **-e "pEventId"**

    Short event tag used in file names. It is also the Id used to access
    the specific event details in the `./vid-tag.conf` file. If the
    pEventId is not found, then it will be added to `./vid-tag.conf`.

    The value will be changed to lower-case and any spaces will be changed
    to '\_'

    Pattern token: **%e**.  Config var: `Event`. Required: "pEventId"

- **-E "pEventTitle"**

    Long event name used in the title.

    Pattern token: **%E**.  Config var: `Title`. Default: "Long
    event description."

- **-c "pCity"**

    City name.

    Pattern token: **%c**.  Config var: `City`. Default: "city name"

- **-C "pCaption"**

    Caption / description metadata.

    Config var: `Caption`. Default: "Copyright TERMS"

- **-p "pInitials"**

    Photographer's initials / short name (no spaces).

    Pattern token: **%p**.  Config var: `NameShort`.

- **-P "pName"**

    Photographer's full name.

    Pattern token: **%P**.  Config var: `NameLong`. Default: First
    Last

- **-R "pCopyright"**

    Copyright stamp.

    Config var: `Copyright` Default: "Copyright NAME YYYY"

- **-f "pFilePattern"**

    Output file-name pattern.  Usually you will only use the lowercase
    pattern options, because they should not have any spaces or special
    characters in them.

    Config var: `FilePat`. Default: `%d_%e_%p_%f`.

- **-t "pTitlePattern"**

    Title pattern.  Usually you will use the uppercase pattern options,
    but the lowercase options can be used.

    Config var: `TitlePat`. Default: `%D, %c, %E, by %P.`

- **-k "pKeyword"**

    Comma-separated keyword list.

    Config var: `Keyword`. Default: "PBP, event"

- **-z "pTimeZone"**

    Config var: `TimeZone`.  Default: `local` (no conversion).

    When set to a value other than `local`, each file's CreateDate is
    converted from **pTimeZone** to the host's local time before it is used
    for the output filename, and all the other EXIF time settings.

    Pattern: `UTC[+-]H` or `UTC[+-]H:MM`.  The `UTC` prefix is
    case-insensitive (`utc-1` is accepted).

    Examples:

        -z utc-1     # zone 1 hour ahead of UTC
        -z UTC+8     # zone 8 hours behind UTC
        -z UTC-5:30  # zone 5h30m ahead of UTC
        -z utc-8:03  # your PST time was off be 3 min.
        -z local     # explicit "no conversion"

- **-T**

    Generate thumbnail images for each input video.  Equivalent to
    `Thumb="yes"` in the conf file.  The thumbnail is a JPG with the same
    base name as the renamed video file, extracted with ffmpeg from a
    single frame and then annotated with convert(1).

    The extraction time is `ThumbTime["FILE"]` from the conf when set,
    otherwise `cgThumbTimeDefault` (5 seconds in).  If the file has an
    `Extra["FILE"]` title or a `ThumbTime["FILE"]` entry, the thumbnail
    is annotated at the top-left with that text (and the time in
    parentheses when ThumbTime is set).  A second annotation in the centre
    shows "VIDEO-->", prefixed with the segment count for files that will
    be split (e.g. "3 files VIDEO-->").

    The thumbnail's EXIF is copied from the video and its DateTimeOriginal
    / CreateDate / ModifyDate / mtime are set to one second before the
    video's CreateDate.

    Config var: `Thumb`. Default: `no`.

- **-n**

    No-execute / dry-run.  Validate inputs and create config file
    `./vid-tag.conf`, but do not create output/, rename files, or modify
    metadata.

- **-h**

    Output this "long" usage help.  This is the same as `-H long`.

- **-H pStyle**

    Output usage in a specific style:

        short|usage - short usage, text
        long|text   - full usage, text
        man         - man page
        html        - HTML page
        md          - Markdown
        
        int         - Output internal documentation as text.
        int-html    - Output internal documentation as html.
        int-md      - Output internal documentation as markdown.

- **-v**

    Verbose output.  Repeat for more detail (**-vv**).

        (default) - warnings and errors only
        -v        - notice, warnings, and errors
        -vv       - info, notice, warnings, and errors

- **-V**

    Output the script's version.

- **-d**

    Debug level. Default: 0

    Each -d increments the debug level. Debug messages will be printed
    if the debug level is greater than the debug message's debug level.

## Pattern Tokens

    %c   city name            (-c)
    %d   file date short      "YYYY-MM-DD"
    %D   file date long       "YYYY-MM-DD WWW"
    %T   file date full       "YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS"
    %e   event short          (-e)
    %E   event long           (-E)
    %f   original file name   (path stripped)
    %p   photographer short   (-p)
    %P   photographer long    (-P)

## Config File Format

This is the config file (`./vid-tag.conf`) format.  The file is a
**bash include file**: each line is a bash variable assignment that is
sourced by vid-tag at startup.  The variables have specific names that
vid-tag looks for and assigns to its internal `gp*` globals.

    Caption="..."                # pCaption          (-C)
    Copyright="..."              # pCopyright        (-R)
    FilePat="%d_%e_%p_%f"        # pFilePattern      (-f)
    NameLong="..."               # pName             (-P)
    NameShort="..."              # pInitials         (-p)
    TitlePat="%D, %c, %E, by %P." # pTitlePattern    (-t)
    Event="pEventId"             # pEventId          (-e)
    City="..."                   # pCity             (-c)
    Title="..."                  # pEventTitle       (-E)
    Keyword="word, word"         # pKeyword          (-k)
    TimeZone="UTC[+-]H[:MM]"     # pTimeZone         (-z)
    Thumb="yes"                  # pThumb            (-T)
    Extra["FILE1"]="extra title for FILE1"   # optional, per-file
    Extra["FILE2"]="extra title for FILE2"   # ...
    ThumbTime["FILE1"]="MM:SS or HH:MM:SS"   # optional, per-file

Because the file is just bash, you can include comments (lines
starting with `#`) and may even compute values dynamically.  The
syntax is verified with `bash -n` before the file is sourced.

The **Extra** entries are optional.  Each key is the exact basename of
an input file (case-sensitive); the value is the text that will be
appended to that file's EXIF Title.  Files without a matching key are
unaffected.

The append rule: a single space follows the title's trailing '.', then
the "extra" text, then a closing '.'.

When vid-tag exits, it rewrites `./vid-tag.conf` with the final
effective values (defaults + previous conf + any command-line
overrides), so the next run will only need the file list.

# RETURN VALUE

0 on success; non-zero on error.

# ERRORS

    + No input files given.
    + exiftool is not installed or not on PATH.
    + File not found: <filename>

Warnings (processing continues):

    + No CreateDate in <file>; using file mtime
    + output/<file> already exists
    + target exists, skipping: <old> -> <new>
    + exiftool returned error on <file>

# NOTES

All of this code is maintained at:

    https://github.com/TurtleEngr/vid-tag

The releases are marked with vM.m.p tags.

## Standard version numbering scheme

vM.m.p tags.

M - major version number. The program may not work with previous
versions of command line options or config files.

m - minor version number. New features or bug fixes have been added.
It will probably work with previous versions of command line options
or config files, but new features might not work with older versions.

p - patch version number. There have only been cosmetic changes. For
example, typos, documentation changes, and maybe some very minor bug
fixes.

Any time there is a new "Release," one of these numbers will be
incremented.

Also if you are looking at this on github, the "development" branch is
for newer (maybe untested) versions (where the version number will
likely be different from a released version). The "main" branch is
where the official released code lives, with the vM.m.p tags.

# CAVEATS

This script is mainly for Linux systems. However, if you have CygWin
installed on your Windows PC, and you have install the Required
packages, definded in the SEE ALSO section, and set your PATH env.,
this could work. For MacOS you'll probably want to install "brew" to
get the Required programs.

If you do get this running on Windows or MacOS, please let me know,
with an "issue" report (label it with "enhancement" or
"documentation"). What did you do to get it running. For example
include other programs needed, configuration directions, and any
changes you made to the scripts. If you know github, fork the vid-tag
repo, add your changes, then send me a "pull" request, to the
"develop" branch.

# DIAGNOSTICS

This tool comes with a test script to verify the vid-tag script is
working OK.  Download these files (the VER should match vid-tag's
VER):

    vid-tag-test-VER.zip
    vid-tag-test-input.zip (4.5G)

From: https://moria.whyayh.com/rel/released/software/own/vid-tag/

Unzip vid-tag-test-VER.zip to the install dir.

Unzip vid-tag-test-input.zip to a "test" directory. In the test
directory run:

    ./vid-tag.test -T all

If you don't have space for the vid-tag-test-input.zip files, just use
the "fast" test option for vid-tag.test. For example:

    vid-tag.test -T fast
