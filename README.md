# NAME vid-tag

Rename video files and set Title / Caption / Keywords metadata.

# SYNOPSIS

First run. Create config file: ./vid-tag.conf

    vid-tag -n -e "pEventId" [File1 File2 ...]

Edit config files, and/or use these options to override config file.

    vid-tag -e "pEventId" File1 [File2 ...]
        [-p "pInitials"] [-P "pName"] [-C "pCaption"] [-R "pCopyright"]
        [-E "pEventTitle"] [-c "pCity"] [-k "pKeyword"]
        [-f "pFilePattern"] [-t "pTitlePattern"]
        [-z "pTimeZone"]
        [-n] [-h] [-H pStyle] [-v] [-d]

# DESCRIPTION

vid-tag renames one or more video files and writes Title, Caption, and
Keywords metadata using the `exiftool`.  The file's `Create Date`
metadata is read and used to date-stamp the output file name, the
output title, and the file-system mtime.

Files are copied to the ./output/ directory, so the original files are
not changed in any way.

Files (in ./output/) will be renamed using the pFilePattern and the
EXIF values will be added to the renamed files

Large files, greater than 10 min, will be split into multiple 10 min
parts (because some hosting sites do not allow "large" files). The
exif time stamps for the split files will update for each 10 min part.

An example file, `./vid-tag-example.txt`, will be created to show the
changes that are (or will be) made to the files with the current
settings. This is best used with the -n option and if you include all the
files, the time stamps will match what is in the files.

If the timestamps for the files are "off" by a consistent amount
the time-zone (-z) config option can be used to adjust the times.

The config options are read in this order (each layer overrides the
previous):

- Built-in script defaults.
- Local config: `./vid-tag.conf` If the file does not exist it
will be created, and updated with the latest default settings.
- Command-line options will override all other settings.

After all the values are set, the results are saved to
`./vid-tag.conf` so the next run will only need the -e option and the
file list.

## QUICK START

### Install

- Download the latest packaged zip file, `vid-tag-VER.zip` from

        https://moria.whyayh.com/rel/released/software/own/vid-tag/

- Unpack the zip file to your "bin" dir.

    Typical choices:

        /usr/local/bin
        $HOME/bin
        /opt/vid-tag

    Just make sure the install dir is in your PATH env. var.

### First run of vid-tag

- cd to the directory with your video files (or the directory
where you want ./output/ created).  Copy the vid-tag.conf file from
the install dir. This is optional. If missing a default version will
be created.

        Run: vid-tag -n -e testevent

- That will create or update ./vid-tag.conf and vid-tag-example.txt
files.
- You can now edit the vid-tag.conf file, or use the command line
options to update the file. You want to change "testevent" to a short
ID that will be put in your renamed video files. See the -e option.

### Tips

- See the -f option for how you can change the file naming
pattern, and the -t option for how you can change the Title pattern.
- Use the -v option to see some progress information. Use -vv if
you want to see more progress details.
- After each run, the vid-tag.conf file is updated with any
changes, and the `vid-tag-example.txt` file will summarize how the
files are modified.
- Between each run you should probably remove everything in the
./outputs/ directory. Or you can leave the files there and they will
be skipped from any changes.
- Use the -z option if the file time are off by a consistent
ammount, because you forgot to set the current time with your camera,
or your camera uses UTC times and you want them adjusted to the local
time.

# OPTIONS

- **-e "pEventId"**

    Short event tag used in file names. It is also the Id used to access
    the specific event details in the `./vid-tag.conf` file. If the
    pEventId is not found, then it will be added to `vid-tag.conf`.

    The value will be changed to lower-case and any spaces will be changed
    to '\_'

    Pattern token: **%e**.  Config key: `event.tag`. Required: "pEventId"

- **-E "pEventTitle"**

    Long event name used in the title.

    Pattern token: **%E**.  Config key: `event.title`. Default: "Long
    event description."

- **-c "pCity"**

    City name.

    Pattern token: **%c**.  Config key: `event.city`. Default: "city name"

- **-C "pCaption"**

    Caption / description metadata.

    Config key: `com.caption`. Default: "Copyright TERMS"

- **-p "pInitials"**

    Photographer's initials / short name (no spaces).

    Pattern token: **%p**.  Config key: `com.name-short`.

- **-P "pName"**

    Photographer's full name.

    Pattern token: **%P**.  Config key: `com.name-long`. Default: First
    Last

- **-R "pCopyright"**

    Copyright stamp.

    Config key: `com.copyright` Default: "Copyright NAME YYYY"

- **-f "pFilePattern"**

    Output file-name pattern.  Usually you will only use the lowercase
    pattern options, because they should not have any spaces or special
    characters in them.

    Config key: `com.file-pat`. Default: `%d_%e_%p_%f`.

- **-t "pTitlePattern"**

    Title pattern.  Usually you will use the uppercase pattern options,
    but the lowercase options can be used.

    Config key: `com.title-pat`. Default: `%D, %c, %E, by %P.`

- **-k "pKeyword"**

    Comma-separated keyword list.

    Config key: `event.keyword`. Default: "PBP, event"

- **-z "pTimeZone"**

    Config key: `event.time-zone`.  Default: `local` (no conversion).

    When set to a value other than `local` (or empty),
    each file's CreateDate is converted from **pTimeZone** to the host's
    local time before it is used for the output filename, and all the
    other EXIF time settings.

    Pattern: `UTC[+-]H` or `UTC[+-]H:MM`.  The `UTC` prefix is
    case-insensitive (`utc-1` is accepted).

    Examples:

        -z utc-1     # zone 1 hour ahead of UTC
        -z UTC+8     # zone 8 hours behind UTC
        -z UTC-5:30  # zone 5h30m ahead of UTC
        -z utc-8:03  # your PST time was off be 3 min.
        -z local     # explicit "no conversion"

- **-n**

    No-execute / dry-run.  Validate inputs and create config file
    **./vid-tag.conf**, but do not create output/, rename files, or modify
    metadata.

- **-h**

    Output this "long" usage help.  This is the same as `-H long`.

- **-H pStyle**

    Output usage in a specific style:

        short|usage - short usage, text
        long|text   - full usage, text
        man         - man page
        html        - HTML page
        md          - Markdown
        
        int         - Output internal documentation as text.
        int-html    - Output internal documentation as html.
        int-md      - Output internal documentation as markdown.

- **-v**

    Verbose output.  Repeat for more detail (**-vv**).

        (default) - warnings and errors only
        -v        - notice, warnings, and errors
        -vv       - info, notice, warnings, and errors

- **-V**

    Output the script's version.

- **-d**

    Debug level. Default: 0

    Each -d increments the debug level. Debug messages will be printed
    if the debug level is greater than the debug message's debug level.

## Pattern Tokens

    %c   city name            (-c)
    %d   file date short      "YYYY-MM-DD"
    %D   file date long       "YYYY-MM-DD WWW"
    %T   file date full       "YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS"
    %e   event short          (-e)
    %E   event long           (-E)
    %f   original file name   (path stripped)
    %p   photographer short   (-p)
    %P   photographer long    (-P)

## Config File Format

This is the config file (`./vid-tag.conf`) format.
The value of `$gpEventId` is the primary key.

    [vid-tag "com"]
        file-pat   = %d_%e_%p_%f (pFilePatern)
        title-pat  = %D, %c, %E, by %P. (pTitlePattern)
        name-long  = Photographer Name (pName)
        name-short = Initials (pInitial)
        copyright  = pCopyright
        caption    = pCaption
    [vid-tag "pEventId"]
        title      = Long Event Title (pEventTitle)
        city       = pCity
        keyword    = word, word (pKeyword)
        time-zone  = UTC[+-]H[:MM] | local (pTimeZone) - optional
    [vid-tag "extra"]
        FILE1      = extra title text for FILE1 - optional
        FILE2      = extra title text for FILE2 - optional
        ...

The **\[vid-tag "extra"\]** section is optional.  Each key is the exact
basename of an input file (case-sensitive); the value is the text that
will be appended to that file's EXIF Title.  Files without a matching
key are unaffected.

The append rule: a single space follows the title's trailing '.', then
the "extra" text, then a closing '.'.

time-zone - is optional.  Omit (or set to `local`) to disable the
CreateDate timezone conversion.  See the **-z** option for the format
and semantics.

# RETURN VALUE

# CAVEATS

This script is mainly for Linux systems. However, if you have CygWin
installed on your Windows PC, and you have install the Required
packages (and set your PATH env.) this could work. For MacOS you'll
probably want to install "brew" to get the Required programs.

If you do get this running on Windows or MacOS, let me know, with an
"issue" report, what you had to do to get it running. For example
include programs needed, configuration directions, and any changes
you made to the scripts.

# DIAGNOSTICS

This tool comes with a test script to verify vid-tag script is working
OK.  Download these files:

    vid-tag-test-VER.zip
    vid-tag-test-input.zip (4.5G)

from: https://moria.whyayh.com/rel/released/software/own/vid-tag/

Unzip vid-tag-test-VER.zip to the install dir.

Unzip vid-tag-test-input.zip to a "test" directory. In the test
directory run vid-tag.test.

If you don't have space for the vid-tag-test-input.zip files, just use
the "fast" test option for vid-tag.test. For example:

    vid-tag.test -T fast
